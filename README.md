#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. Thus it involves the design, development , testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.
The importance of software engineering in the technology industry is by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Three milestones in the evolution of software engineering are:
The development of programming languages(the birth of software engineering)- the term software engineering was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference where by it highlighted the software crisis where it emphasized the need for structured programming methods, formalized software development processes, and engineering principles to manage complexity.
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s- during this period, structured programming became a standard approach to writing clear, maintable code.
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s- this is when the agile manifesto was introduced shifting software development from rigid, waterfall-based models to interactive, customer-focused methodologies. It emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement thus enabkes faster and more adaptive software development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The SDLC consists of several phases including:
Planning- it involves defining project goals, scope , budget, and feasibility.
Requirements- gathering and documenting designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Design- it involves creating highlevel and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation(coding and development)- writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing- conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment-this is realising the software to users or customers.
Maintenance and support- provides ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall- this is the sequential approach with distinct phases that is requirements, design, implementation flow downwards like a waterfall. Its best for well-defined projects with stable requirements.
Agile- this is iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. Its best for dynamic projects where requirements may change frequently.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- is responsbile for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality  Assurance Engineer- is responsible for ensuring software meets quality standards by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager- oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs is software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debuggung, and testing code examples are Visual Studio and Eclipse.
VCS- is software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members examples are Git, GitHub and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers face numerous challenges including:
Changing requirements where they may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays. The strategy would be effective communication.
Tight deadlines where high expectations, short deadlines and long hours can lead to stress and burnout. The strategy would be prioritization of tasks using time management techniques and taking regular breaks and maintain a work-life balance. 
Managing project Complexity where large-scale projects involve multiple components, dependecies, and team collaboration. The strategy would be using agile methodologies to break tasks into manageable sprints.
Collaborating with teams and managing code conflicts where working with multiple developers can lead to merge conflicts, miscommunication, and inefficiencies. The strategy would be using version control systems like Git with best practices.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- is testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration testing- testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System testing- testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing- testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance in software quality assurance:
Confirms the product is user-friendly and meets expectations.
Helps prevent costly changes after release.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts (inputs) to optimize responses from AI models like ChatGPT.
Importance in interacting with AI models:
Enhances AI response quality- well structured prompts help AI generate more accurate, relevant, and insightful responses.
Improves efficiency and productivity- a clear prompt reduces the need for multiple follow-ups, saving time and effort.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a vague report is: "Tell me about cars."
Improved prompt: "Explain the key differences between electric and gasoline-powered cars, including their environmental impact and cost of ownership."
Why the improved prompt is more effective:
More specific- instead of broadly discussing cars, the focus is on electic vs gasoline-powered cars.
Clear intent- it asks for a comparisson, ensuring a structured response.
Concise yet detailed- includes key aspects like environmental impact and cost of ownership.
